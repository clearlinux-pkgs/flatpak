Major changes in 0.6.0
======================

Renamed from xdg-app to Flatpak.  Existing repositories should keep
working, and locally user installed apps/runtime will be migrated
automatically. However, there are some things that you have to be
aware of:
 * The command names are now flatpak/flatpak-builder
 * System-wide installed apps/runtimes need to be reinstalled
 * flatpak-builder uses a ".flatpak-builder" subdirectory instead
   of ".xdg-app-builder".
 * The bus name and interface name for the permission
   store is changed, it was in org.freedesktop.XdgApp, but is
   now in org.freedesktop.impl.portal.DesktopPortal.
 * The installation migration is a one-time operation so you can't
   go back to xdg-app after updating.
 * The library API (and name) changed due to the rename.

Other changes:
 * Flatpak now hard-requires ostree 2016.5
 * Switch from using xdg-app-helper to an included version of bubblewrap:
   https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap
 * Added a policykit-based system helper that allows you to authenticate
   via polkit to install into the system repository.
 * Added an experimental command to export/import applications and runtimes
   as an OCI tarball.
 * builder: Fix creation of locale extensions if there was no locale data in the
   build.
 * Its now possible to disable/enable configured remotes.
 * A lot of new tests where added, and we now support installed tests.
 * builder now has an optional --arch argument for multiarch building.
 * Builder modules can be disabled with "disabled": true.
 * Using --filesystem=/tmp now hides the system X11 sockets.


Major changes in 0.5.2
======================

* The way locale extensions work has changed. Now we build a single extension
  for all locales, but we allow you to specify a subset of it during installation
  and update time using the --subpath commandline flag.
  The main reason for this is that the many extensions didn't scale, both in
  technical terms (large ostree summary file size), but also in terms of the
  UI listing hundreds of uninteresting things.
* We no longer use sizes in the commit objects to get installed and download size,
  instead we store some extra metadata in the summary file. This allows us
  to get much faster access to these, as with recent ostree versions we can
  cache the summary file.
* New command xdg-app build-sign that lets you sign a commit at any time.
* New argument xdg-app build --force-clean that removes pre-existing build dirs.
* xdg-app run now uses the "current" version as the default if you specify no
  branch or arch. It used to default to the "master" branch. This will default
  to the last installed version, but can be changed with xdg-app make-current.
* Added config-opts to the build-options in xdg-app-builder. This allows you
  to extend the configure flags in an arch dependent way.
* Documentation updates

* Add sources to Debug extensions created by xdg-app-builder
* Allow specifying subdirs of xdg-* dirs, for instance:
   --filesystem=xdg-download/some-dir

Major changes in 0.4.9
======================
* Fix crash at end of runtime install.
* xdg-app-builder has a new source type "shell" which lets you run arbitrary
  shell commands.
* Allow apps with writable homedir access to modify the xdg-app repos.
* New xdg-app info command gives you status of an installed app or runtime.
* The xdg-app-builder cache now contains the sdk commit id, so that a new
  version of the sdk invalidates the cache.
* Fixed a regression in the xdg-app install-app backwards compatibility
  handling.
* xdg-app now gives the application access to the deployment path, which can
  be used to give host-side services access to app files (such as help
  documents).
* build-export no longer exports appstream files, and when generating appstream
  files we don't need them to be.
* The default architecture tag used by xdg-app is now made canonical when needed
  (i.e. on arm/x86/mips).

Major changes in 0.4.8
======================
* Changed global installation directory to /var/lib/xdg-app (not /var/xdg-app).
* Add support for a dbus filtering on the system bus.
* Choosing user namespaces or setuid is now a runtime option, not build time.

Major changes in 0.4.7
======================
* Enabled build of libxdg-app by default, now the API is stable
  enough for e.g. gnome-software to use it.
* Restructured the command line interface to xdg-app, it is now
  more streamlined and easy to use. For instance, to install
  both apps or runtimes, now use "xdg-app install $name".
  The old commands still work, but are deprecated and not
  in the docs.
* xdg-app-builder has gotten a bunch of new features that
  makes it easier to build apps, and some initial work to
  make it possible to create runtimes using it
* build-export now finds and export any app-info installed by
  the app, and build-update-repo collects all such exports
  into a per-repo branch for appstream and icons.
* The client (and libs) support for locally mirroring the appstream
  branch for each remote. This allows use to create graphical appstores
  with user-readable information and icons.
* On the client side one can now specify priorities for each
  remote.

Major changes in 0.4.6
======================
* Added an initial version of libxdg-app, a highlevel library
  intended to be used by user interface frontends to xdg-app.
  It is not yet API stable, so it is disabled by default.
  Enable with --enable-libxdgapp
* Added xdg-app-builder, a separate tool that makes it easier to build
  applications with external dependencies.
* Add support for single-file bundles, which can be a useful way
  to distribute apps on e.g. a usb stick. Only works with the
  latest version of ostree.
* Always allow apps to talk to the built-in portals
* Support granting read-only access to the filesystem with e.g. --filesystem=host:ro

* Put nvidia drivers in sandbox if DRI allowed

Major changes in 0.4.0
======================
* A new permissions store was added to the dbus api.
  This can be used by portal implementations that want to store
  per-app permissions for objects.
* The document portal was added. This is a dbus api
  which you can use to create document ids and assign
  apps permissions to see these documents. The documents
  themselves are accessed via a custom fuse filesystem.
* perf and strace are now blocked via the seccomp filters
* You can now override application metadata on a system
  and per-user level, giving apps more or less access
  than what they request.
* New command modify-remote added which lets you change
  configuration of a remote after it has been added with
  add-remote.
* Support for adding trusted gpg keys on a per-remote basis
  has been added to add-remote and modify-remote.
