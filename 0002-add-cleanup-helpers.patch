+# For a while, Clear Linux* OS shipped an empty /var/lib/flatpak/repo dir
+# which turned into an unusable flatpak, we initialize flatpak now by using
+# `flatpak remote-list --system` which populates the /var/lib/flatpak
+# structure correctly (see /usr/lib/systemd/system/flatpak-init.service)
+#
+# This script will stay for a while to ensure that we cleanup our own mess
+# around flatpak initialization, so if (and only if)
+# `flatpak remote-list --system` fails and the error output is about our
+# messy directory in /var/lib/flatpak, we proceed with the cleanup.
